More Control. Less Code. +
Functional Library for Java 8+

Rahel Lüthy – http://twitter.com/netzwerg999[@netzwerg999]

== Javaslang

* Immutable collections
* Functional control structures

== Why?

Fundamental nonsense at the heart of programming:
{blank}
{blank}
```
x = x + 1
```
{blank}
But it's an assignment, I hear you say – well...

== Math Functions vs. Java Methods

Math
```
y = sin(x)
```
{blank}
Java
```java
List<String> doSomething(List<String> list)
```
== Math Functions

```
y = sin(x)
```
* 1 input -> 1 output
* same input -> same output
* referential transparency

== Data In – Data Out

* Known as *pure* or *side-effect-free*
* Easy to understand
* Easy to test

== Java Methods

{blank}
```java
List<String> doSomething(List<String> list)
```
{blank}

* 3 potential inputs
* 5 potential outputs

== Java Methods

* 3 potential inputs
* 5 potential outputs

== Garbage In – Garbage Out

[.smaller]
* 3 potential inputs
** parameters
** instance state
** global state
* 5 potential outputs
** return value
** mutable instance state
** mutable global state
** mutable parameters
** exceptions

== Why Is This Bad?

* Hard to write, read & test
* Shared mutable state is evil

== We Can Do Better!

[.smaller]
* **1** potential input
** {y} parameters
** {n} instance state – static methods, pass as param
** {n} global state - pass as param
* **1** potential output
** {y} return value
** {n} mutable instance state - immutability
** {n} mutable global state - immutability
** {n} mutable parameters - immutability
** {n} exceptions - pass as return value

== Immutability

* No side effects
* Fewer possible interactions
* Sharing becomes safe
* Deep-copying becomes unnecessary
* `==` implies `equals`

== Functional Programming

If we only use immutable data, we need functional control structures

== Readable Code

Programs as data pipelines

Function calls can mentally be replaced by their results

== A Simple Mental Model

Your brain can focus on the scope of one method.

You can be sure that nothing else is relevant.
