More Control. Less Code. +
Functional Library for Java 8+

== Javaslang

* Immutable collections
* Functional control structures

== Why?

Fundamental nonsense at the heart of programming:
{blank}
{blank}
```
x = x + 1
```
{blank}
But it's an assignment, I hear you say – well...

== Math Functions vs. Java Methods

Math
```
y = sin(x)
```
{blank}
Java
```java
List<String> doSomething(List<String> list)
```
== Math Functions

```
y = sin(x)
```
* 1 input -> 1 output
* same input -> same output
* referential transparency

== Java Methods

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::../../main/java/ch/netzwerg/javaslang/Snippets.java[tags=input-output]
----
* 3 potential inputs (parameter, instance state, global state)
* 3 potential outputs (return value, mutable parameter, exception)
* Goodbye readability...

== We Can Do Better!

* Static (no instance state access)
* Pass global state as parameters
* Immutable input parameters
* Make exceptions explicit

== Immutability

* `==` implies `equals`
* Sharing becomes safe
* Deep-copying becomes unnecessary
* Fewer possible interactions

== Functional Programming

If we only use immutable data, we need functional control structures

== Data In – Data Out

* Known as *pure* or *side-effect-free*
* Easy to understand (just like math)
* Easy to test

== Readable Code

Programs as data pipelines

Function calls can mentally be replaced by their results

== A Simple Mental Model

Your brain can focus on the scope of one method.

You can be sure that nothing else is relevant.
