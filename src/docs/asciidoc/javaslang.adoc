More Control. Less Code. +
Functional Library for Java 8+

== Javaslang

* Immutable collections
* Functional control structures

== Why Immutability?

* Shared mutable state is evil
* Many possible interactions (hard to test...)
* Implementations need to handle all of them in a safe way
* *This is hard!*

== Immutability

* `==` implies `equals`
* Sharing becomes safe
* Deep-copying becomes unnecessary
* Fewer possible interactions

== Functional Programming

If we only use immutable data, we need functional control structures

== Data In – Data Out

* Known as *pure* or *side-effect-free*
* Easy to understand (just like math)
* Easy to test

== Readable Code

Programs as data pipelines

Function calls can mentally be replaced by their results

== A Simple Mental Model

Your brain can focus on the scope of one method.

You can be sure that nothing else is relevant.
